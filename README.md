This is a sample project demonstrating how to build a Node.js application using TypeScript. It includes configuration files and sample code to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed. It comes bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:


This will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

## Usage

To build the TypeScript code and start the application, run:


This will compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript and start the Node.js server.

## Development

To start the development server with automatic reloading on file changes, run:


This will start the development server using `nodemon` and automatically reload the server when changes are detected in the TypeScript files.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute:


This will run the test suites using your configured test runner (e.g., Jest, Mocha, etc.).
